My name is Ted Jesus Chua and I am a senior at Emory  University graduating this summer with a degree in economics. However, my passion lies in public health. Having been born and raised in Naga City, Philippines, I lived under a poor public health system growing up; the dengue epidemic was especially prevalent when I was in elementary school. This systemic problem persists with the COVID-19 pandemic today. Using my economics degree, I want to pursue a career where I can play a critical role in maintaining the health of my community. My background in economics allows me to address public health issues from an empirical perspective, namely through causal inference using mathematics and statistics.

During my sophomore year, I had the privilege of working at the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank with a team of researchers to gather data on patients who have cardiovascular problems at Emory University Hospital. I spent the following summer in an internship at the City of Atlanta's watershed investigations unit, where I communicated proper protocols of legally restoring service with Atlanta residents who are under investigation for water theft. In my free time, I also maintain a GitHub profile to document the empirical projects that I complete using Python and R. These projects range from examining the interconnectivity of music to analyzing the effects of a recession of housing prices. As I finish my last semester of undergraduate studies, I am looking for positions in health policy research where I can apply my skills in data analysis.
